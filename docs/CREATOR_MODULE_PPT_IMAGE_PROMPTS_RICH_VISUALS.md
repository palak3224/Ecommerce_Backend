## Pre‑Prompt (paste once)

You are generating a cohesive set of **high-quality, visually engaging PPT slide images** for a technical/product research presentation about the AOIN platform’s **Creator/Influencer module**.

### Must-know concepts (AOIN module)
- AOIN is an e-commerce platform with roles: user/customer, merchant, super_admin.
- New role: **Creator/Influencer** (not a merchant; has no products).
- Merchant hires creators via **Deal/Campaign** for a specific **AOIN product**.
- Creator uploads reels linked to **campaign_id/campaign_code** → links to product_id, merchant_id, creator_id.
- Attribution rule: **last-touch** within an attribution window (example 7 days).
- Settlement: commission calculated on **net sale**, eligible after **delivery + return window**, refunds reverse.

### Visual style (IMPORTANT: make it interesting)
- Style: **modern cinematic illustration** or **semi-3D isometric** (choose one and keep consistent).
- Use **friendly characters** (simple illustrated humans), not photorealistic.
- Tone: premium, tech-product, clean but lively.
- Background: subtle gradient or soft textured background, not plain white.
- Use a consistent brand palette: deep navy, teal, warm orange, neutral gray.
- Add depth: soft shadows, layered cards, glowing highlights for key steps.
- Use readable headings, but keep text minimal (big labels, few words).
- Include UI elements as **beautiful mockups** (cards, modals, dashboards) with legible text.
- Format: **16:9**, PPT slide ready.
- Do not include long paragraphs; prefer icons, labels, arrows, step numbers.

### Characters (keep consistent across all slides)
Use recurring characters:
- Merchant: “Store owner” character with storefront badge.
- Creator: “Content creator” character with camera/phone + creative vibe.
- Customer: casual shopper.
- AOIN system: friendly AI/robot mascot or platform hub icon.
Keep their look consistent across images.

### Output rule
Each prompt must generate **one complete slide visual** with a clear composition and minimal but readable labels.
